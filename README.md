# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project analyzes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset to predict breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Key techniques like Random Forest for feature selection and PCA for dimensionality reduction were applied. 

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Importance using Random Forest
- Predictive Modeling with KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression
- Clustering using K-Means
- Model comparison based on F1 scores

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the R file in RStudio.
3. Run the code to load and analyze the dataset.
4. Use the model comparison results to predict cancer diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- R
- Random Forest
- PCA
- KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
